# ATS - SQL-DB (MariaDB)

This repository contains a database structure that was developed as part of a bachelor's thesis about Asset Tracking in Hospitals written in German.
For this reason, many of the variable names and comments are written in German.

The code for creating the database can be found in "DB-SQL-Script.sql".
The other two SQL files are intended for the initial filling of the database so that it can be tested after creation.
